### 1. **Export UI Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Implemented | **Date:** 2025-10-29

**What Was Done:**
- ✅ Created `core/pattern_exporter.py` with full export functionality
- ✅ Added Export button to Preview Tab UI
- ✅ Export format selector (bin, hex, leds, json, ledproj)
- ✅ File dialog with format selection
- ✅ Support for 5 export formats

### 2. **Edge Case Improvements** ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Implemented | **Date:** 2025-10-29

**Implemented Improvements:**

#### a. **Pattern Locking During Flash** ✅
- ✅ Creates pattern copy before flash operation
- ✅ Locks pattern during flash
- ✅ Warns if pattern modified/replaced during flash
- ✅ Prevents conflicts between editing and flashing

#### b. **File Loading Protection** ✅
- ✅ Loading flag prevents multiple simultaneous loads
- ✅ Warns user if loading already in progress
- ✅ Confirms before replacing unsaved patterns

#### c. **Large File Handling** ✅
- ✅ File size check before loading
- ✅ Warning dialog for files >10MB
- ✅ User confirmation before loading large files

#### d. **Tab Load Error Recovery** ✅
- ✅ try-except around each tab's `load_pattern()` call
- ✅ Continues with other tabs if one fails
- ✅ Pattern stored in MainWindow before tab sync
- ✅ Status bar reports partial failures

**Files Updated:**
- `ui/main_window.py` (error recovery, loading protection, large file warnings)
- `ui/tabs/flash_tab.py` (pattern locking)

## 🚀 Remaining Optional Enhancements (Future Work)

---

### 2. **STM32/PIC Uploader Full Implementation** ⚠️ Medium
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 4-6 hours each

**Current Status:**
- Templates exist for STM32 and PIC
- Uploader classes exist with basic structure
- Toolchain setup detection exists

**Missing:**
- Full upload workflow implementation
- Hardware testing and validation
- Error handling refinement

**Files:**
- `uploaders/stm32_uploader.py` - Needs completion
- `uploaders/pic_uploader.py` - Needs completion

**Recommendation:** Implement when specific hardware is available for testing.

---

### 4. **WiFi Upload Enhancements** (from WIFI_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md) 🚀 Future
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 8-12 hours

**Planned Features:**
- OTA firmware updates over WiFi
- Pattern scheduling (time-based changes)
- Remote brightness control
- Pattern library on ESP8266
- Multi-device synchronization

**Status:** Nice-to-have features, not critical for current functionality.

---

### 5. **Hardware Verification Tests** ⚠️ Medium
**Priority:** Medium | **Effort:** 6-8 hours

**Current Status:**
- Software tests exist
- Hardware verification missing

**Missing:**
- Automated hardware connectivity tests
- Upload verification with real devices
- Pattern playback verification on actual LEDs

**Recommendation:** Create when access to test hardware is available.

---

### 6. **Batch Flashing UI** 🚀 Future
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 8-10 hours

**Current Status:**
- `core/batch_flasher.py` exists (core logic)
- No UI for batch operations

**Missing:**
- Batch flashing tab or dialog
- Device selection UI
- Batch progress monitoring
- Queue management

**Files:**
- `ui/tabs/batch_flash_tab.py` (new file needed)

**Recommendation:** Implement when batch operations are needed.

---

### 7. **Pattern Library System** 🚀 Future
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** 12-16 hours

**Planned Features:**
